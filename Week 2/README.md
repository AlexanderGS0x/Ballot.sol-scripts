# Week 2 weekend homework - Ballot.sol + scripts

## The Plan

- Pre-work:
    - Make sure everyone's `deployWithEthers.ts` works
    - come up with a list of proposals to pass when initiating `Ballot.sol`

- Steps:
    - list each script that will need to be written
    - sudo code these scripts
    - assign members to write scripts

- Final Homework Goal:
    - Deploy Ballot.sol (only one member needs to deploy. this member will be the "chairperson")
    - Record transactions for following actions:
        - deployment
        - chairperson giving voting rights to members
        - some members vote
        - some members delegate
            - delegated members vote
        - call `winningProposal()`
        - call `winnerName()`
